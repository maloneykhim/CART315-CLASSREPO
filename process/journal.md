## Game Analysis

### Find a game that you know well or are interested by. What decisions have the designers made that cause the game to be interesting? Where have they failed? Think mechanically rather than thematically. What ideas/methods/techniques do you think you could borrow for future projects?


One of my favorite game is Undertale. In Undertale, we play as a young human child who accidentally fell from a cliff into the world of monsters and has to find their way out. Unlike most traditional RPGs where combat often involves defeating enemies through violence, Undertale introduces a turn-based combat system where players can choose to fight, act, or show mercy to enemies. 

I really like this mechanic because it lets our actions have consequences. In most games of the same genre, random enemies are used as fodders for the player that needs to kill to grind experience points, they often don't even have a personality and are there to delay the final boss fight (who actually has a storyline). In Undertale, each and every character has a name, a personality and their existence affects the lives of other. Every decision, from sparing or killing enemies to interacting with NPCs, affects the storyline and characters' perceptions of the player. The game features multiple branching paths and endings, encouraging players to explore different choices and consequences.

During battles, enemies attack the player using a variety of projectiles and patterns, creating what is often referred to as "bullet hell" gameplay. The player's soul, represented by a small red heart, moves within a box, and they must dodge enemy attacks by maneuvering the heart around the screen. Each enemy has its own unique attack patterns and behaviors, requiring players to adapt and react quickly to survive.

In combat, players have several options for interacting with enemies:

Fight: The player can choose to engage in traditional combat by selecting the "Fight" option. This initiates an attack sequence where players must time their button presses to inflict damage on the enemy. The strength of the player's attacks depends on their timing and the enemy's defenses.

Act: The "Act" option allows players to interact with enemies in non-violent ways. Depending on the enemy, players can perform various actions such as talking, complimenting, joking, or petting. Each enemy has specific actions that may affect their behavior or disposition towards the player.

Mercy: As players interact with enemies through the "Act" option, they may eventually gain the ability to spare them. Sparing enemies allows players to end the battle peacefully without resorting to violence. However, showing mercy often requires fulfilling specific conditions or engaging in particular actions during the battle.

As for what Undertale has failed at, I personally don't think it's a big issue, but the pixel artstyle is pretty minimalistic and could be improved to make it even more immersive/memorable.

I already have RPG Maker MV on my Steam account and would love to create a RPG game inspired by Undertale with a rich narrative.
