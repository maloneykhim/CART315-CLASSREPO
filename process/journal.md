## Week 5 - Game Analysis

### Find a game that you know well or are interested by. What decisions have the designers made that cause the game to be interesting? Where have they failed? Think mechanically rather than thematically. What ideas/methods/techniques do you think you could borrow for future projects?


One of my favorite game is Undertale. In Undertale, we play as a young human child who accidentally fell from a cliff into the world of monsters and has to find their way out. Unlike most traditional RPGs where combat often involves defeating enemies through violence, Undertale introduces a turn-based combat system where players can choose to fight, act, or show mercy to enemies. 

I really like this mechanic because it lets our actions have consequences. In most games of the same genre, random enemies are used as fodders for the player that needs to kill to grind experience points, they often don't even have a personality and are there to delay the final boss fight (who actually has a storyline). In Undertale, each and every character has a name, a personality and their existence affects the lives of other. Every decision, from sparing or killing enemies to interacting with NPCs, affects the storyline and characters' perceptions of the player. The game features multiple branching paths and endings, encouraging players to explore different choices and consequences.

During battles, enemies attack the player using a variety of projectiles and patterns, creating what is often referred to as "bullet hell" gameplay. The player's soul, represented by a small red heart, moves within a box, and they must dodge enemy attacks by maneuvering the heart around the screen. Each enemy has its own unique attack patterns and behaviors, requiring players to adapt and react quickly to survive.

In combat, players have several options for interacting with enemies:

Fight: The player can choose to engage in traditional combat by selecting the "Fight" option. This initiates an attack sequence where players must time their button presses to inflict damage on the enemy. The strength of the player's attacks depends on their timing and the enemy's defenses.

Act: The "Act" option allows players to interact with enemies in non-violent ways. Depending on the enemy, players can perform various actions such as talking, complimenting, joking, or petting. Each enemy has specific actions that may affect their behavior or disposition towards the player.

Mercy: As players interact with enemies through the "Act" option, they may eventually gain the ability to spare them. Sparing enemies allows players to end the battle peacefully without resorting to violence. However, showing mercy often requires fulfilling specific conditions or engaging in particular actions during the battle.

As for what Undertale has failed at, I personally don't think it's a big issue, but the pixel artstyle is pretty minimalistic and could be improved to make it even more immersive/memorable.

I already have RPG Maker MV on my Steam account and would love to create a RPG game inspired by Undertale with a rich narrative.





## Week 6 - Shmup Remix Journal

### Stage 1: Pong game Clone

I tried to recreate Pong Game, but there was a bug with my Unity so I didn’t get to finish it.

### Stage 2: Breakout game Clone

I followed a tutorial online from YouTube (https://youtu.be/jyXZ3RVe5as?si=P3pzBW0JORjl7mJf) on how to create a simple Breakout game. I then personalized it by changing the colors.

### Stage 3: Shmup Remix


[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1HujyxbqE8g/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HujyxbqE8g&ab_channel=MaloneyKhim)


Mollika and I teamed up for the last stage of this project. We followed a tutorial on Udemy (https://concordia.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/ )
on how to create a Laser Defender Game, but we completely changed the visual and audio of our game and named it Bug Bites. We went with a nature theme with our player character being a frog. The frog is trying to eat bugs by killing them with his laser saliva, but the insects are also defending themselves by trying to kill him with their own laser attacks. Before starting to code, we created the assets on Photoshop and Piskel for a pixel art aesthetic. Then, we downloaded the sound effects and background music from OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/forest) and Kenney.nl(https://www.kenney.nl/assets/impact-sounds). Our game is meant to be played on a phone ( with a 9:16 format) or an Apple iPhone SE simulator on Unity.

While working on this project, we had many, many issues. There were problems with transferring our files from a MacBook to a Windows laptop, so we had to mostly separate our work and then combine it together with GitHub. On Mollika’s MacBook, there were issues with the boundaries of the game (the player was leaving the boundaries of the screen) so we had to ask help from Sabine to fix it. Unity also once crashed and corrupted itself on Mollika’s version of the project, fortunately, there was a copy of the project on Maloney’s laptop so that wasn’t a big issue. Also, while creating a parallax background, the frog got stuck on the center of the screen and we couldn’t move it at all so we once again had to get help from the Computation Lab to fix this bug.

During the playtesting, other students have stated they enjoyed playing our game, saying that they liked the look of our game and enjoyed the camera shaking effect when the player gets hit. As criticism, they suggested to us to add a working main menu and game over pages and that it would be nice to have more type of enemies in the game. After the playtesting session, we added those changes to our game.  

### Description of game play:

- Arrows keys for moving
- Space bar for attacking
- Defeat the insects to get the most amount of points possible!

### Reflection:

Creating our Shmup Remix game was both tough and fun. After all, this project almost made us lose our minds.
Moving our work between different computers was a hassle. We had to use GitHub to combine everything, and sometimes things didn't go smoothly. We also had issues with the game boundaries and Unity crashing.
But, despite the challenges, we had a blast working together. We helped each other out and didn’t gave up. Now, we know we need to be more organized for future projects. We'll make sure to save our work properly, use GitHub better, and communicate more clearly.
In the end, making the Shmup Remix game taught us a lot about teamwork and problem-solving. We're excited to use what we've learned in our next adventure!







## Week 7 - Ideation Process

Contributors to the final project : Maloney Khin & Mollika Chakraborty

We wanted to create an RPG game and brainstormed a lot to get some ideas. We searched online for existing games and Unity tutorials that could inspire us for our game. Here are the three best ideas we've got:

Emotion RPG: The player embark on an introspective journey where they must navigate the tumultuous landscape of their character's mind, balancing positive and negative emotions while confronting past traumas and stressors. As they delve deeper into their psyche, they uncover the keys to inner harmony and emotional resilience, ultimately finding peace within themselves.

Revenge Heist RPG : The player take on the role of a daring thief seeking to reclaim treasures plundered by the British Empire from colonized nations, blurring the lines between hero and antagonist. As they assemble a team and plan intricate heists, players navigate a morally ambiguous world where their actions shape the fate of historical artifacts and the lives of those affected by colonialism.

Trapped in a computer RPG: This game plunges the player into a digital nightmare when a seemingly innocuous laptop purchased from a yard sale transports them into a virtual realm overrun by a malevolent computer virus. As they navigate through treacherous digital landscapes and engage in strategic battles against viral entities, players must unravel the mysteries of the cyber world and find a way to escape before it's too late.




## Week 8 - Prototype 1

We decided to go with our second idea: the Museum Heist game!

### Feedback from last class (March 7th)

- Make it a Stealth-Platformer game 
- Incorporate various types of enemies 
- Make it informative in a witty way, for example at the end of the game producing the list of items the ninja recovered and stating facts about the items, the country they belong to or how it was stolen. 
- Adding ghosts like creatures inspired from Harry Potter movies and books. 
- Make the character hide at the certain occasions within the game, this keeps the mystery alive. 
- Go with a pixel art aesthetic

### Gameplay

The player assumes the role of a daring thief on a mission to reclaim treasures plundered by the British from various countries throughout history. With a ticking clock adding urgency, the thief must navigate through a museum, aiming to locate and steal as many treasures as possible before making a clean getaway. To access certain prized artifacts, keys are essential, hidden within chests guarded by spectral entities. While contact with these ghosts doesn't end the game, it does incur time penalties. Additionally, the thief must evade detection by museum guards and sidestep security lasers, as any encounter with either will result in immediate failure.


### Items to be found in the museum

- The Portland Vase - Italy
- Lamassu - Iraq  
- Moai from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) - Eastern Polynesia.  
- Rosetta Stone - Egypt 
- Koh-i-Noor - India
- Maqdala Manuscripts - Amba Marium/Maqdala


### Type of enemies

- Security guards
- Lasers
- Colonial ghosts (maybe)


### List of assets to be done

- Player character sprites (normal, jump, run, climbing up/down, defeat)
- Main background that is not interactable (museum background with windows, paintings, pillars etc.)
- Interactable assets to move around (ladders, doors, platforms, floor grounds, etc.)
- Key items (to unlock some rooms, a different one for each treasure)
- Treasure items (each one gives the player some points)
- Guards sprites (walking back and forth. The player needs to avoid touching them by jumping on platforms)
- Laser sprites (in some sections of the museum, they go quickly across the room and the player needs to stay immobile to not be detected)
- Colonial ghost sprites (optional, guarding the keys like the guards, but sometimes appear and disappear, makes the player lose time if they get in contact with them)
- Opening & ending cutscene (optional, in a visual novel style or a comic style??)
- UI and stuff
- Title screen and Game over screen
- Music & sound effects (we will get them from the internet)

## Week 8 - Prototype 2

I did some art in Aseprite for our game, more specifically the player character (thief/ninja) and one of the enemy (a security guard). I did walking, climbing and jumping spritesheets for the thief and a walking spritesheet for the security guard. I had to look at a lot of references on Pinterest and it took a while to get used to create pixel art. I've also found some tutorials on visual scripting that allows people to create a game without coding. I might try them later this week.

## Week 9 - Prototype 3

I did more art in Aseprite for our game, this time, it's floor tiles and the items the main character can find. I also had to look at a lot of references to draw the objects. It was a challenge to translate all the details of the real treasures into pixel art. The only art asset we need to do is the background of the game and the UI. We've also decided to speed up our process by using a few free assets from the Udemy course and the internet.

We finally decided to go with C# for our project instead of visual scripting because it is something we're supposed to learn this semester. 

We decided to follow the Tilevania tutorial in this Udemy course and will modify quite a few things to make it fit our game concept. For example our character will not attack the enemy since it's more a "stealth" game than a rpg game.

## Week 10 - Prototype 4

This week Mollika and I focused more on working on Unity. We coded in alternance and I also did a few of the background tile assets. For my part, I drew the ladder tile, the window tiles, the wall tiles and the security laser tiles. There were some issues with the sizing of some of our previous sprites so I had to reupload them in smaller size. Unfortunately, we had a massive bug with the cinemachine collider, which made our player character flash and the background tiles blurry while the camera was moving all the over the place so we had to skip a few parts of the tutorial related to the camera except for the first cinemachine tutorial (88). Also, Molly's github had a weird issue where there were conflicts everywhere in her unity file so we had to create a new branch called "alternate-version" from a previous commit so she could repull her repository. So far, we did everything up to the actual interactions between our character and the artifacts/obstacles.

Stuff that needs to be done before the make-up week:
-Finish the main code of the game
-Main menu of the game
-UI of the game

Stuff that would be nice to have done before the make-up week but not essential:
-Music & SFX
-Introduction scene explaining the story of the game and giving more context
-Ghost enemies


## Week 11 - Final prototype

Our goal this week was to have a fully functional game even though we'll probably have to skip on some more cosmetic elements of the game. 

After Molly made the code of the enemies work (security guards walking back and forth and laser flashing on and off), I worked on finalising the map layout of the game, placing items such as the background tiles, the artifacts, the security guards/security lasers and then testing the game to see if it is beatable. If there were issues where the player gets stuck, I would try to move around the tiles to create a balance between difficulty and fun. Also I drew a final pixel art tile set: a pillar, and added it a few places in the museum. It looks especially good with the lighting effect that Molly added, really adds some atmosphere!

I also coded the "pickup" of the artifacts and the scoring/lives of the game. Basically, the player has three attempts to get the most artifacts possible. The further an artifact is situated on the map, the more points it gives. If they lose all their lives, the player restarts the game. I also added a sound effect to the artifact pickup as well as a background music to the game. 

Furthermore, I made my little sister, someone completly uninvolved in the creation of the game, play it to get her comments. She was a bit confused by what artifacts we had to pick up but found it quite fun in general. After receiving the criticism from last week's prototype presentation, we wanted to add a clearer story context to the game as well as some instructions/introduction about what artifact to pick up, but because of the time crunch, we didn't have the opportunity to add them. We also wanted to add some more sound effects like the walking, the jumping, the climbing, the laser hitting but again, I didn't have the time to add them. Perhaps we'll work on these during the summer break? 

All in all, it was a challenging, yet rewarding project, we had tons of issues with Github but we also learned a lot about Unity (C# language), drawing pixel art and the ideation/design part of a game. We are proud of our game and will probably add it to our portfolio after it's been more refined!
