## Game Analysis

### Find a game that you know well or are interested by. What decisions have the designers made that cause the game to be interesting? Where have they failed? Think mechanically rather than thematically. What ideas/methods/techniques do you think you could borrow for future projects?


One of my favorite game is Undertale. In Undertale, we play as a young human child who accidentally fell from a cliff into the world of monsters and has to find their way out. Unlike most traditional RPGs where combat often involves defeating enemies through violence, Undertale introduces a turn-based combat system where players can choose to fight, act, or show mercy to enemies. 

I really like this mechanic because it lets our actions have consequences. In most games of the same genre, random enemies are used as fodders for the player that needs to kill to grind experience points, they often don't even have a personality and are there to delay the final boss fight (who actually has a storyline). In Undertale, each and every character has a name, a personality and their existence affects the lives of other. Every decision, from sparing or killing enemies to interacting with NPCs, affects the storyline and characters' perceptions of the player. The game features multiple branching paths and endings, encouraging players to explore different choices and consequences.

During battles, enemies attack the player using a variety of projectiles and patterns, creating what is often referred to as "bullet hell" gameplay. The player's soul, represented by a small red heart, moves within a box, and they must dodge enemy attacks by maneuvering the heart around the screen. Each enemy has its own unique attack patterns and behaviors, requiring players to adapt and react quickly to survive.

In combat, players have several options for interacting with enemies:

Fight: The player can choose to engage in traditional combat by selecting the "Fight" option. This initiates an attack sequence where players must time their button presses to inflict damage on the enemy. The strength of the player's attacks depends on their timing and the enemy's defenses.

Act: The "Act" option allows players to interact with enemies in non-violent ways. Depending on the enemy, players can perform various actions such as talking, complimenting, joking, or petting. Each enemy has specific actions that may affect their behavior or disposition towards the player.

Mercy: As players interact with enemies through the "Act" option, they may eventually gain the ability to spare them. Sparing enemies allows players to end the battle peacefully without resorting to violence. However, showing mercy often requires fulfilling specific conditions or engaging in particular actions during the battle.

As for what Undertale has failed at, I personally don't think it's a big issue, but the pixel artstyle is pretty minimalistic and could be improved to make it even more immersive/memorable.

I already have RPG Maker MV on my Steam account and would love to create a RPG game inspired by Undertale with a rich narrative.

## Shmup Remix Journal

### Stage 1: Pong game Clone

I tried to recreate Pong Game, but there was a bug with my Unity so I didn’t get to finish it.

### Stage 2: Breakout game Clone

I followed a tutorial online from YouTube (https://youtu.be/jyXZ3RVe5as?si=P3pzBW0JORjl7mJf) on how to create a simple Breakout game. I then personalized it by changing the colors.

### Stage 3: Shmup Remix

Mollika and I teamed up for the last stage of this project. We followed a tutorial on Udemy (https://concordia.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/ )
on how to create a Laser Defender Game, but we completely changed the visual and audio of our game. We went with a nature theme with our player character being Sylvester the Frog. Sylvester is trying to eat bugs by killing them with his laser saliva, but the insects are also defending themselves by trying to kill him with their own laser attacks. Before starting to code, we created the assets on Photoshop and Piskel for a pixel art aesthetic. Then, we downloaded the sound effects and background music from OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/forest) and Kenney.nl(https://www.kenney.nl/assets/impact-sounds). Our game is meant to be played on a phone ( with a 9:16 format) or an Apple iPhone SE simulator on Unity.

While working on this project, we had many, many issues. There were problems with transferring our files from a MacBook to a Windows laptop, so we had to mostly separate our work and then combine it together with GitHub. On Mollika’s MacBook, there were issues with the boundaries of the game (the player was leaving the boundaries of the screen) so we had to ask help from Sabine to fix it. Unity also once crashed and corrupted itself on Mollika’s version of the project, fortunately, there was a copy of the project on Maloney’s laptop so that wasn’t a big issue. Also, while creating a parallax background, the frog got stuck on the center of the screen and we couldn’t move it at all so we once again had to get help from the Computation Lab to fix this bug.

During the playtesting, other students have stated they enjoyed playing our game, saying that they liked the look of our game and enjoyed the camera shaking effect when the player gets hit. As criticism, they suggested to us to add a working main menu and game over pages and that it would be nice to have more type of enemies in the game. After the playtesting session, we added those changes to our game.  

### Reflection:

Creating our Shmup Remix game was both tough and fun. After all, this project almost made us lose our minds.
Moving our work between different computers was a hassle. We had to use GitHub to combine everything, and sometimes things didn't go smoothly. We also had issues with the game boundaries and Unity crashing.
But, despite the challenges, we had a blast working together. We helped each other out and didn’t gave up. Now, we know we need to be more organized for future projects. We'll make sure to save our work properly, use GitHub better, and communicate more clearly.
In the end, making the Shmup Remix game taught us a lot about teamwork and problem-solving. We're excited to use what we've learned in our next adventure!
