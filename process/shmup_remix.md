## Shmup Remix Journal

### Stage 1: Pong game Clone

I tried to recreate Pong Game, but there was a bug with my Unity so I didn’t get to finish it.

### Stage 2: Breakout game Clone

I followed a tutorial online from YouTube (https://youtu.be/jyXZ3RVe5as?si=P3pzBW0JORjl7mJf) on how to create a simple Breakout game. I then personalized it by changing the colors.

### Stage 3: Shmup Remix

Mollika and I teamed up for the last stage of this project. We followed a tutorial on Udemy (https://concordia.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/ )
on how to create a Laser Defender Game, but we completely changed the visual and audio of our game and named it Bug Bites. We went with a nature theme with our player character being a frog. The frog is trying to eat bugs by killing them with his laser saliva, but the insects are also defending themselves by trying to kill him with their own laser attacks. Before starting to code, we created the assets on Photoshop and Piskel for a pixel art aesthetic. Then, we downloaded the sound effects and background music from OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/forest) and Kenney.nl(https://www.kenney.nl/assets/impact-sounds). Our game is meant to be played on a phone ( with a 9:16 format) or an Apple iPhone SE simulator on Unity.

While working on this project, we had many, many issues. There were problems with transferring our files from a MacBook to a Windows laptop, so we had to mostly separate our work and then combine it together with GitHub. On Mollika’s MacBook, there were issues with the boundaries of the game (the player was leaving the boundaries of the screen) so we had to ask help from Sabine to fix it. Unity also once crashed and corrupted itself on Mollika’s version of the project, fortunately, there was a copy of the project on Maloney’s laptop so that wasn’t a big issue. Also, while creating a parallax background, the frog got stuck on the center of the screen and we couldn’t move it at all so we once again had to get help from the Computation Lab to fix this bug.

During the playtesting, other students have stated they enjoyed playing our game, saying that they liked the look of our game and enjoyed the camera shaking effect when the player gets hit. As criticism, they suggested to us to add a working main menu and game over pages and that it would be nice to have more type of enemies in the game. After the playtesting session, we added those changes to our game.  

### Description of game play:

- Arrows keys for moving
- Space bar for attacking
- Defeat the insects to get the most amount of points possible!

### Reflection:

Creating our Shmup Remix game was both tough and fun. After all, this project almost made us lose our minds.
Moving our work between different computers was a hassle. We had to use GitHub to combine everything, and sometimes things didn't go smoothly. We also had issues with the game boundaries and Unity crashing.
But, despite the challenges, we had a blast working together. We helped each other out and didn’t gave up. Now, we know we need to be more organized for future projects. We'll make sure to save our work properly, use GitHub better, and communicate more clearly.
In the end, making the Shmup Remix game taught us a lot about teamwork and problem-solving. We're excited to use what we've learned in our next adventure!
