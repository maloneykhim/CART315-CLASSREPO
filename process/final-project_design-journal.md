# Final Project 

## Step 1 - Ideation Process

Mollika, Negar and I teamed up to work on this project. We wanted to create an RPG game and brainstormed a lot to get some ideas. We searched online for existing games and Unity tutorials that could inspire us for our game. Here are the three best ideas we've got:

Emotion RPG: The player embark on an introspective journey where they must navigate the tumultuous landscape of their character's mind, balancing positive and negative emotions while confronting past traumas and stressors. As they delve deeper into their psyche, they uncover the keys to inner harmony and emotional resilience, ultimately finding peace within themselves.

Revenge Heist RPG : The player take on the role of a daring thief seeking to reclaim treasures plundered by the British Empire from colonized nations, blurring the lines between hero and antagonist. As they assemble a team and plan intricate heists, players navigate a morally ambiguous world where their actions shape the fate of historical artifacts and the lives of those affected by colonialism.

Trapped in a computer RPG: This game plunges the player into a digital nightmare when a seemingly innocuous laptop purchased from a yard sale transports them into a virtual realm overrun by a malevolent computer virus. As they navigate through treacherous digital landscapes and engage in strategic battles against viral entities, players must unravel the mysteries of the cyber world and find a way to escape before it's too late.
