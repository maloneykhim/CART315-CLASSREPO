# Final Project 

## Step 1 - Ideation Process

We wanted to create an RPG game and brainstormed a lot to get some ideas. We searched online for existing games and Unity tutorials that could inspire us for our game. Here are the three best ideas we've got:

### Emotion RPG

Concept:

The game centers around a human character navigating the complexities of life, striving for a balance between happiness and sadness. Players guide the character through a world filled with emotional landscapes. Happiness and sadness are not seen as opposing forces, but rather complementary aspects of a fulfilling life.

Gameplay:

The objective is to accumulate both happy and sad points while maintaining a state of equilibrium. Different obstacles represent challenges commonly encountered in real life, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. These obstacles manifest as dark, glowing blobs that the character must maneuver around or interact with to earn emotional points.

Future Development:

We plan to further refine the point system, assigning unique values and characteristics to each type of emotional obstacle. We also envision introducing levels with increasing difficulty and complexity.


### Revenge Heist RPG

Concept:

The game takes place within the vast halls of the British Museum. Players control a mysterious figure, an embodiment of historical restitution. They navigate the museum, seeking to return stolen artifacts to their rightful cultural homes. The game explores the complex issue of historical artifacts and their cultural significance. It encourages players to consider the perspectives of both the colonizer and the colonized. While repatriation is a central theme, the narrative acknowledges the potential challenges faced by museums that house these collections.

Gameplay:

The protagonist acts as both hero and villain. They must locate and interact with hidden mechanisms or puzzles within the museum exhibits to trigger the repatriation of artifacts. This act could involve creating a symbolic connection or offering a heartfelt apology.

However, the protagonist is not alone.  Museum guards and security systems represent the resistance to returning stolen treasures. Players must utilize stealth, agility, and quick thinking to evade capture and complete their mission.

Future development:

Introduce playable characters who represent different stolen artifacts, each with unique abilities.
Include educational elements that provide historical context for the artifacts and the countries they originated from.
Offer different difficulty levels, with harder levels presenting more complex puzzles and stricter security measures.
Consider incorporating moral choices or consequences based on how the player interacts with museum objects.

### Trapped in a computer RPG

Your screen flickered, then blackness. You landed hard in a neon world of code and data rivers. A disembodied voice explained â€“ you're digitized, trapped by a rogue program. Now, you're humanity's last hope in a digital war. You are now trapped in your device and have to fight viruses to get out. 

Gameplay:

Escape the System: Your primary goal is to find a way out of the digital world and return to your body. This exit point is heavily guarded, requiring you to navigate through the system's most critical components.
Collect Data Fragments: Scattered throughout the digital world are fragments of system data. These fragments hold vital information about the system's weaknesses and can be used by you to create powerful temporary upgrades for you.
Defeat the Master Virus: Master Virus resides deep within the Hard Drive, You must face the Master Virus in a final showdown to cleanse the system and ensure your escape.

You are the digitized human, utilizing your agility and newfound digital abilities to navigate the landscape.
Basic attacks like punches and kicks can neutralize weaker viruses. As you collect data fragments, you can upgrade your abilities, allowing you to charge attacks, perform double jumps, or deflect projectiles. Jump across data streams, climb binary structures, and avoid environmental hazards.
Hidden warp zones within the Hard Drive can be accessed by solving logic puzzles, leading to bonus levels with more data fragments and powerful enemies.
Defeating viruses rewards you with experience points that unlock new skills and passive buffs.

The Master Virus:

This final boss is a corrupted code. It can manipulate the environment, creating electrical storms and summoning powerful virus minions. To defeat it, you'll need to exploit its vulnerabilities and utilize the full range of your upgraded abilities.
