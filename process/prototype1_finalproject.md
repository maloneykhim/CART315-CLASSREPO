## Feedback from last class (March 7th)

- Make it a Stealth-Platformer game 
- Incorporate various types of enemies 
- Make it informative in a witty way, for example at the end of the game producing the list of items the ninja recovered and stating facts about the items, the country they belong to or how it was stolen. 
- Adding ghosts like creatures inspired from Harry Potter movies and books. 
- Make the character hide at the certain occasions within the game, this keeps the mystery alive. 

## Gameplay

The player assumes the role of a daring thief on a mission to reclaim treasures plundered by the British from various countries throughout history. With a ticking clock adding urgency, the thief must navigate through a museum, aiming to locate and steal as many treasures as possible before making a clean getaway. To access certain prized artifacts, keys are essential, hidden within chests guarded by spectral entities. While contact with these ghosts doesn't end the game, it does incur time penalties. Additionally, the thief must evade detection by museum guards and sidestep security lasers, as any encounter with either will result in immediate failure.


# Items to be found in the museum

- The Portland Vase - Italy
- Lamassu - Iraq  
- Moai from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) - Eastern Polynesia.

# Type of enemies

- Security guards
- Lasers
- Colonial ghosts


# List of assets to be done

- Player character sprites (normal, jump, run, climbing up/down, defeat)
- Main background that is not interactable (museum background with windows, paintings, pillars etc.)
- Interactable assets to move around (ladders, doors, platforms, floor grounds, etc.)
- Key items (to unlock some rooms, a different one for each treasure)
- Treasure items (each one gives the player some points)
- Guards sprites (walking back and forth. The player needs to avoid touching them by jumping on platforms)
- Laser sprites (in some sections of the museum, they go quickly across the room and the player needs to stay immobile to not be detected)
- Colonial ghost sprites (optional, guarding the keys like the guards, but sometimes appear and disappear, makes the player lose time if they get in contact with them)
- Opening & ending cutscene (optional, in a visual novel style or a comic style??)
- UI and stuff
- Title screen and Game over screen
- Music & sound effects (we will get them from the internet)
